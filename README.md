### 7-segment

This is the Adafruit 4-Digit 7-Segment LED Matrix Display FeatherWing! This 7-segment FeatherWing backpack makes it really easy to add a 4-digit numeric display with decimal points and even 'second colon dots' for making a clock.

This version does not come with an LED matrix. Its also available in combo packs of Blue, Green, Red, White, or Yellow which we recommend since you'll know you have a working LED matrix. Not guaranteed to work with any other 7-segment modules.

### 14-segment

This is the Adafruit 0.56" 4-Digit 14-Segment Display FeatherWing! This 14-segment FeatherWing backpack makes it really easy to add a bright alphanumeric display that shows letters and numbers in a beautiful hue. It's super bright and designed for viewing from distances up to 23 feet (7 meters) away.

14-Segment Matrices like these are 'multiplexed' - so to control all the fourteen-segment LEDs you need 18 pins. That's a lot of pins, and there are driver chips like the MAX7219 that can control a matrix for you but there's a lot of wiring to set up and they take up a ton of space. Wouldn't it be awesome if you could control a matrix without tons of wiring? That's where these Alphanumeric LED Matrix FeatherWings come in, they make it really easy to add a 4-digit alphanumeric display with decimal points.

interface. There are multiple selectable I2C addresses. For backpacks 
with 3 Address Select pins: 0x70 thru 0x77
